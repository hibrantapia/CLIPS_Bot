#### Colaborative College Project - Make sure to check out the authors.

This is a simple chatbot using the C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) programming language, developed at NASAâ€™s Johnson Space Center. //
CLIPS is useful for creating expert systems and other programs where a heuristic solution is easier to implement and maintain than an algorithmic solution. //
This chatbot recommends based on simple questions what kind of anime you might like.

1. In this simple GitHub Repository, I uploaded 1 file "Chatbot_Anime.clp", containing the resource code of our game.
2. You don't need anything special to run the program.
